# Dual Universe Augmented Reality Tools  

## Overview  
This project provides augmented reality (AR) tools designed to assist builders in **Dual Universe**. With tools like the **Straight Line Drawing Tool**, you can create precise and symmetrical designs, making your building process more efficient and accurate.  

## Features  
- **Straight Line Drawing Tool:**  
  - Easily draw straight lines to help align and structure your builds.  
  - Ideal for creating clean, symmetrical, and professional designs.  

## Installation  
Follow these steps to set up the AR tools in your construct:  
1. Add a **Programming Board** to the construct you are working on.  
2. Open the JSON file from this repository and copy its contents.  
3. Paste the copied JSON code into the **Programming Board**.  
4. Link your **Core Unit** to the **Programming Board**.  

Thatâ€™s it! The tool is now ready to use.  

## Usage  
- Access the Programming Board to activate and control the tools.  
- Use the Straight Line Drawing feature for precise alignment and construction.  

## Roadmap  
Planned features include:  
- Additional drawing tools (curves, grids, etc.).  
- Enhanced AR visualization of in-game structures.  
- Integration with in-game Lua scripting for expanded functionality.
